# DSAwithJAVA
I have started my programming journey with JAVA using java jdk17 on Ubuntu 20.04 machine. Learned what is java from scratch :
i) Java architecture
ii) JVM and its function.
iii) VMs and stuff (extra resource).
iv) Compilation.
Basics of programming :
i) Types of languages (C, C++, Java, python, etc)
Procedural                                           | functional                                            | object-Oriented
a) tells us about a series of well defined steps and | Writes a program in its pure form ie it never changes | Revolves only around objects, classes and functions.

                                                                                                             | Includes code, elements/data, objects.
b) contains a set of commands, scripts and functions |Used when we have to carry out lots of different opera |

ii) Understanding of memory management. (Heap, stack, dynamic memory allocation, compile time-run time
